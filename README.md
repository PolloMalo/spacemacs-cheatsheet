# Spacemacs Cheatsheet

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a useful, compact cheatsheet of spacemacs keyboard
shortcuts to refer to when it's difficult to remember keyboard shortcuts.

Open the `spacemacs-cheatsheet.html` file in your web browser to view it.

My focus at the moment is on the essential keyboard shortcuts needed to accomplish
common tasks, as well as those for Clojure development.
